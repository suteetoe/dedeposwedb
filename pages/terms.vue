          By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply
          to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully
          before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app,
          any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed
          to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also
          shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make
          derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks,
          copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights
          related to it, still belong to SMLSoft Co.,Ltd.
        </p>

        <p>
          SMLSoft Co.,Ltd is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
          efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
          changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
          any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services
          without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
        </p>

        <p>
          The dede Pos app stores and processes personal data that you have
          provided to us, to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to
          keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
          that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
          removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
          operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
          to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
          security features and it could mean that the dede Pos app won’t work
          properly or at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and
          Conditions.

        You should be aware that there are certain things that SMLSoft Co.,Ltd
        will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will
        require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
        can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but SMLSoft
        Co.,Ltd cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
        functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any
        of your data allowance left.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
        remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network
        provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
        mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection
        while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app,
        you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming
        data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
        region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the
        bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware
        that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
        using the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the same lines, SMLSoft Co.,Ltd cannot always take responsibility
        for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device
        stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to
        avail the Service, SMLSoft Co.,Ltd cannot accept responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        With respect to SMLSoft Co.,Ltd’s responsibility for your use of the
        app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that
        although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all
        times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
        we can make it available to you. SMLSoft Co.,Ltd accepts no liability
        for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
        wholly on this functionality of the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
        available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for the both
        systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
        availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the
        updates if you want to keep using the app. SMLSoft Co.,Ltd does not
        promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
        and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed
        on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
        application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the
        app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
        termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
        (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b)
        you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
      </p>
